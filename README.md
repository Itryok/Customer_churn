# Customer_churn

A strong customer base is an important requirement of running a successful business as it shows a lot about the quality of business and its nature of fostering relationships with its customers.
It is easier to maintain relations and retain existing customers, rather than drawing in newer customers. This is why understanding the rate of customer churn and its impacts is very important in the functioning of any business.

# Implementation
In this project we will attempt to perform pre-clustering of the given dataset by an unsupervised model. Then we will supply that as an input to the supervised model which predicts customer churn.
